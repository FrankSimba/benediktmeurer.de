So I'm trying to get used to [OS X Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)
now. One of the first things I noticed was that the <code>Library</code>
folder does no longer show up in Finder by default. Of course that was
rather trivial to fix using the following command:

{% highlight console %}
$ chflags nohidden ~/Library
{% endhighlight %}

One really nice feature in Lion is that new tabs in
[Terminal.app](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Terminal) now inherit the
current working directory from the tab from which they were opened - something
I implemented in [Xfce's Terminal](http://www.xfce.org/projects/terminal)
seven years ago, BTW. In addition the title bar of Terminal windows now
provides the same handles as the title bar in Finder windows, which is pretty
handy.

Unfortunately Apple decided to kick Spaces and replace it with [Mission
Control](http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/mission-control.html). This
by itself is not necessarily bad, but now there's no way to get that two
dimensional workspace layout back, at least until Apple decides
to fix that shortcoming. I've also noticed that the order of the workspaces
seems to change under some (obscure) conditions, which is even worse. Maybe
I'm just getting old, but until now I was unable to figure out what triggers
this rearrangement - not what I'd call intuitive.
