  <p>
    Make sure that PhotoAccess is actually running in the foreground. You cannot
    access the web interface while PhotoAccess is in the background.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make sure that you entered the correct URL, especially make sure that you
    did not forget the colon and the port (i.e. <code>:8080</code>). Also make
    sure that the computer from which you are trying to access the photos is on
    the same (WiFi) network as the iOS device running PhotoAccess.
  </p>
  <p>
    If all fails, try to reinstall PhotoAccess by removing it from your device
    and downloading it again from the App Store.

  <p>
    I don't have plans to backport PhotoAccess to iOS 3.

  <h2 id="ipad">Will you create a native iPad / iPad HD version?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes.
