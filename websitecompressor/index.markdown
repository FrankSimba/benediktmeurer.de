## About

WebsiteCompressor is a small, fast and very easy to use Java utility that minifies a whole website, with all CSS, HTML, JavaScript and XML files by removing extra whitespaces, comments and other unneeded characters without breaking the content structure. As a result the pages become smaller in size and load faster.
